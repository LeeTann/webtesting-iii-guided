## What to test

- does it render?
- does it render correctly / the right things?
- does it renders expected output based on props/state/default state?
- does it handle event correctly?

-edge/corner cases
    - does it do the right thing when passed invalid input?

## Good Unit Tests

- fast
- test one thing/assumption
- independent
- multiple assertions are ok
